Developed a full-stack web application for tracking expenses and income using ASP.NET Core MVC and C#. Implemented CRUD operations for managing expense categories and transactions using Syncfusion components like grids, forms, and modals. Integrated data visualization with Syncfusion chart components (donut charts, spline charts) to display expense and income data. Utilized Entity Framework Core with Code-First migrations for database operations and SQL Server for data storage.
