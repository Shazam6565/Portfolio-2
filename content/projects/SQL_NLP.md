The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent natural language processing (NLP) bot that can understand and execute SQL queries based on user input in plain English. The bot will leverage the LangChain framework to integrate with a SQL database, parse natural language queries, generate corresponding SQL statements, execute them on the database, and present the results in a user-friendly format.
