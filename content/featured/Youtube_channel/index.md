Through my YouTube livestream channel, I facilitate learning in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI. Using Python for scripting, I provide clear explanations and practical examples of Large Language Models, including building transformer models on customized textual data. I also plan to release full-length tutorials on developing AI-powered applications using the [Langchain framework](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/), [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview), and open-source models like [LLam3](https://ollama.com/library/llama3). My goal is to make complex concepts accessible and engaging, helping viewers implement advanced techniques.
