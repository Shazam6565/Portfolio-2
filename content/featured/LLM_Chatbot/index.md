Developed an intelligent chatbot for my portfolio site, enabling users/recruiters to discuss my professional career in natural language, trained on custom data like resume and accolades. Utilized [Llama 3](https://ollama.com/library/llama3) (open-source language model), Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(to fetch customized queries), [Chroma Vector DB](https://www.trychroma.com/) (storage and retrieval of embeddings), and [Langchain framework](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) (open-source framework).
